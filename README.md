# MetaMask and Smart Contract Frontend

This project is a simple frontend application designed to connect to MetaMask and interact with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an HTML and JavaScript interface for seamless integration with MetaMask and Web3.js, enabling users to connect to MetaMask, interact with a smart contract, read data from it, and update its state.

## File Structure

  - `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the user interface and functionality.

## Prerequisites

  - MetaMask extension installed in your browser.
  - An Ethereum account with sufficient funds for transactions.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.

2. Open the HTML file:
   Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
      
## Using the Interface

1. **Connect to MetaMask:**

  - Click the "Connect to MetaMask" button.
  - A MetaMask popup will appear asking you to connect your account.
  - After connecting, your Ethereum account address will be displayed.

2. **Connect to the Smart Contract:**

  - Click the "Connect to Smart Contract" button.
  - The interface will establish a connection to the specified smart contract and show a confirmation message.
  
3. **Read Data from the Smart Contract:**

  - Click the "Read String from Contract" button to retrieve a string value.
  - Click the "Read Number from Contract" button to get a number value.
  - The retrieved data will be displayed below the respective buttons.
  
4. **Change Data on the Smart Contract:**

  - Enter a new number in the input field.
  - Click the "Update Smart Contract Data" button.
  - The new number will be sent to the smart contract to update its state.

## Notes
